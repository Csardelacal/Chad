/**
 * Balances are a data type that helps the system capture the amount in an 
 * account to prevent it from having to aggregate all the account's movements.
 * 
 * When the app wants to generate the current balance it only needs to retrieve
 * the latest balance and all movements that occurred since.
 * 
 * To ensure that no transfer is left unchecked, the system will always balance
 * with time()-1 which will then be written into a variable and remain constant
 * throughout the request's lifespan.
 * 
 * @property AccountModel $account   Account this entry balances
 * @property int          $amount    Amount the account contains
 * @property int          $timestamp Number of seconds since unix epoch this balance was made.
