/**
 * This model allows Chad to keep track of which groups have specific 
 * read/write permissions on certain accounts.
 * 
 * Just like applications, groups are not allowed to search the database for 
 * specific tags. Unlike apps, if they provide a meaningful part of the account's
 * ID - Chad will allow querying them.
 * 
 * Meaningful is something along the lines of the first 6 characters of the 
 * account ID. Since these can be extremely long and tedious to type out.
 * 
 * @property string        $group   Group being granted rights
 * @property string        $tag     Tag this group has access to. (If the account is set, this must be null)
 * @property \AccountModel $account Account that the app manages
 * @property bool          $write   Indicates whether the group can read or r/w
 * @property int           $created Timestamp of the record's creation
 * @property string        $blame   Id of the source of the permission
 * @property int           $revoked Timestamp when the app was revoked access
 * 
 * When deleting, the record is not immediately deleted. Instead it should stay 
 * revoked for a good amount of time before the application can safely purge the
 * record from the database.
