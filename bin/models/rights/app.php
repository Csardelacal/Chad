/**
 * This model allows Chad to keep track of which applications have specific 
 * read/write permissions on certain accounts.
 * 
 * Please note that, due to their nature. Applications are not allowed to search
 * for accounts by tag. This is intended to prevent them from extracting data 
 * that they're not supposed to manage.
 * 
 * When an application creates an account, it can decide whether it wants to give
 * it a tag that it can r/w or whether it wants to write itself down as an executor
 * to that account. It can also decide to make the owner an executor of the 
 * account or even prevent them from reading / writing to the account at all.
 * 
 * @property string        $app     Application being granted rights
 * @property string        $tag     Tag this app has access to. (If the account is set, this must be null)
 * @property \AccountModel $account Account that the app manages
 * @property bool          $write   Indicates whether the app can read or r/w
 * @property int           $created Timestamp of the record's creation
 * @property string        $blame   Id of the source of the permission
 * @property int           $revoked Timestamp when the app was revoked access
 * 
 * When deleting, the record is not immediately deleted. Instead it should stay 
 * revoked for a good amount of time before the application can safely purge the
 * record from the database.
